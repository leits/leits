Hi!

I'm leits, an engineering manager with solid background as python engineer. Outside of my work, I'm creating [MeetingBar](https://github.com/leits/MeetingBar) and [ohmycode](https://ohmycode.cc) (beta).

I build stuff in public and make it open-source. Along the way, I learn a lot of new things, which I share on blog and twitter ([@leits_dev](https://twitter.com/leits_dev)).
