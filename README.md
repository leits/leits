Hi!

I'm leits, an engineering manager with solid background as python engineer. Outside of my work, I'm creating [MeetingBar](https://github.com/leits/MeetingBar) and [ohmycode](https://ohmycode.cc)(beta).

I build stuff in public and make it open-source. Along the way, I learn a lot of new things, which I share on blog and twitter.

You can read my latest articles on [leits.me](https://leits.me/blog) or subsribe to my [newsletter](https://leits.substack.com/?r=h8qz8&utm_campaign=pub&utm_medium=web&utm_source=github_profile) as well.
